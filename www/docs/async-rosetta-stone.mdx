When we say "Effection is Structured Concurrency and Effects for
JavaScript", we mean "JavaScript" seriously. You shouldn't have to
learn an entirely new way of programming just to achieve structured
concurrency. That's why the Effection APIs mirror ordinary JavaScript
APIs so closely. That way, if you know how to do it in JavaScript, you
know how to do it in Effection.

The congruence between vanilla JavaScript constructs and their Effection
counterparts is reflected in the “Async Rosetta Stone.”

| Async/Await      | Effection         |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| `await`          | `yield*`          |
| `async function` | `function*`       |
| `Promise`        | `Operation`       |
| `new Promise()`  | `action()`        |
| `for await`      | `for yield* each` |
| `AsyncIterable`  | `Stream`          |
| `AsyncIterator`  | `Subscription`    |

## `await` \<=> `yield*`

Pause a computation and resume it when the value represented by the right hand
side becomes available.

Continue once a promise has settled:

```javascript
await promise;
```

Continue when operation is complete.

```js
yield* operation;
```

## `async function` \<=> `function*`

Compose a set of computations together with logic defined by JavaScript syntax:

Count down from 5 to 1 with an async function:

```js
async function countdown() {
  for (let i = 5; i > 1; i--) {
    console.log(`${i}`);
    await sleep(1000);
  }
  console.log('blastoff!');
}
```

Count down from 5 to 1 with a generator function:

```js
import { sleep } from 'effection';

function* countdown() {
  for (let i = 5; i > 1; i--) {
    console.log(`${i}`);
    yield* sleep(1000);
  }
  console.log('blastoff!');
}
```

Both will print:

```
5
4
3
2
1
blastoff!
```

To call an async function within an operation use [`call()`][call]:

```js
import { call } from 'effection';

yield* call(async function() {
  return "hello world";
});
```

To run an operation from an async function use [`run()`][run] or [`Scope.run`][scope-run]:

```js
import { run } from 'effection';

await run(function*() {
  return "hello world";
});
```

## `Promise` \<=> `Operation`

The `Promise` type serves roughly the same purpose as the `Operation`. It is a
abstract value that you can use to pause a computation, and resume when the
value has been computed.

To use a promise:

```js
let promise = await promise;
```

To use an operation:

```js
let operation = yield* operation;
```

To convert from a promise to an operation, use [`call()`][call]

```js
import { call } from 'effection';

let operation = call(promise);
```

to convert from an operation to a promise, use [`run()`][run] or [`Scope.run`][scope-run]

```js
import { run } from 'effection';

let promise = run(operation);
```

## `new Promise()` \<=> `action()`

Construct a reference to a computation that can be resolved with a callback.
In the case of `Promise()` the value will resolve in the next tick of the run
loop.

Create a promise that resolves in ten seconds:

```js
new Promise((resolve) => { setTimeout(resolve, 10000) });
```

Create an Operation that resolves in ten seconds:

```js
import { action } from 'effection';

action(function*(resolve) { setTimeout(resolve, 10000) });
```

A key difference is that the promise body will be executing immediately, but the
action body is only executed when the action is evaluated. Also, it is executed
anew every time the action is evaluated.

## `for await` \<=> `for yield* each`

Loop over an AsyncIterable with `for await`:

```js
for await (let item of iterable) {
  //item logic
}
```

Loop over a `Stream` with `for yield* each`

```js
import { each } from 'effection';

for (let item of yield* each(stream)) {
  // item logic
  yield* each.next();
}
```

See the definition of [`each()`][each] for more detail.

## `AsyncIterable` \<=> `Stream`

A recipe for instantiating a sequence of items that can arrive over time. It is not
the sequence itself, just how to create it.

Use an `AsyncIterable` to create an `AsyncIterator`:

```js
let iterator = asyncIterable[Symbol.asyncIterator]();
```

Use a `Stream` as an operation to create a `Subscription`:

```js
let subscription = yield* stream;
```

To convert an `AsyncIterable` to a `Stream` use [`stream()`][stream]

```js
import { stream } from 'effection';

let itemStream = stream(asyncIterable);
```

## `AsyncIterator` \<=> `Subscription`

A stateful sequence of items that can be evaluated one at a time.
