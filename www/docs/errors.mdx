We have previously discussed how correctness and proper handling of failure
cases is why we wrote Effection in the first place. In this chapter we will
take a more in-depth look at how Effection handles failures and how you can
react to failure conditions.

## Tasks as Promises

Whenever you call `run` or use the `spawn` operation, Effection
creates a [`Task`][task] for you. This value is a handle that lets you
both respond to the operation's outcome as well as stop its execution.

As we have seen, a Task is not only an Operation that yields the
result of the operation it is running, it is also a promise that can
be used to integrate Effection code into promise based or async/await
code. That promise will resolve when the operation completes successfully:

``` typescript
import { run, sleep } from 'effection';

async function runExample() {
  let value = await run(function*() {
    yield* sleep(1000);
    return "world!";
  });

  console.log("hello", value);
}
```

By the same token, if a task's operation results in an error, then the
task's promise also becomes rejected:

``` typescript
import { run } from 'effection';

async function runExample() {
  try {
    await run(function*() {
      throw new Error('boom');
    });
  } catch(err) {
    console.log("got error", err.message) // => "got error boom"
  }
}
```

However, when an operation is halted, it will never produce a value,
nor will it ever raise an error. And, because it will produce neither
a positive nor negative outcome, it is an error to `await` the result
of a halted operation.

When  this happens, the promise is rejected with a special halt error:

``` typescript
import { run, suspend } from 'effection';

async function runExample() {
  try {
    let task = run(supsend);
    await task.halt();
    await task;
  } catch(err) {
    console.log("got error", err.message) // => "got error halted"
  }
}
```

Notice how it is not an error to `await` the halt operation itself, only to
`await` the outcome of a halted operation.

## Error propagation

One of the key principles of structured concurrency is that when a child fails,
the parent should fail as well. In Effection, when we spawn a task, that task
becomes linked to its parent. When the child operation fails, it will
also cause its parent to fail.

This is similar to the intuition you've built up about how synchronous code
works: if an error is thrown in a function, that error propagates up the stack
and causes the entire stack to fail, until someone catches the error.

One of the innovations of async/await code over plain promises and
callbacks, is that you can use regular error handling with
`try/catch`, instead of using special error handling constructs. This
makes asynchronous code look and feel more like regular synchronous
code. The same is true in Effection where we can use a regular `try/catch`
to deal with errors.

``` typescript
import { main, sleep } from 'effection';

function* tickingBomb() {
  yield* sleep(1000);
  throw new Error('boom');
}

await main(function*() {
  try {
    yield* tickingBomb()
  } catch(err) {
    console.log("it blew up:", err.message);
  }
});
```

However, note that something interesting happens when we instead `spawn` the
`tickingBomb` operation:

``` typescript
import { main, suspend } from 'effection';
import { tickingBomb } from './ticking-bomb';

await main(function*() {
  yield* spawn(tickingBomb);
  try {
    yield* suspend(); // sleep forever
  } catch(err) {
    console.log("it blew up:", err.message);
  }
});
```

You might be surprised that we do *not* enter the catch handler here. Instead,
our entire main task just fails. This is by design! We are only allowed to
catch errors thrown by whatever we yield to directly, _not_ by any spawned
children or resources running in the background. This makes error handling more
predictable, since our catch block will not receive errors from any background
task, we're better able to specify which errors we actually want to deal with.

## Error boundary

If we do want to catch an error from a spawned task (or from a [Resource][]) then
we need to introduce an intermediate task which allows us to bring the error into
the foreground. We call this pattern an "error boundary":

``` typescript
import { main, call, spawn, suspend } from 'effection';
import { tickingBomb } from './ticking-bomb';

main(function*() {
  try {
    yield* call(function*() { // error boundary
      yield* spawn(tickingBomb); // will blow up in the background
      yield* suspend(); // sleep forever
    });
  } catch(err) {
    console.log("it blew up:", err.message);
  }
});
```
