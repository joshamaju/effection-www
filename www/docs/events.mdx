Asynchronous code often needs to interact with evented code. Using
`async/await` this can be quite challenging. Evented code often needs
to be synchronous, because the timing of when to subscribe and
unsubscribe is very critical, otherwise race conditions can occur
where events get missed. Effection has convenient apis to ensure that you never
run into these problems.

## Single events

The simplest operation for working with events that Effection provides
is the [`once()`][once] operation.  This operation works with any
[`EventTarget`][event-target] and blocks until one of its events
occurs. For example, consider that we wanted to wait for the `open`
event on a `WebSocket`, we could do something like this:

``` javascript
import { main, once } from 'effection';

await main(function*() {
  let socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:1234');

  yield* once(socket, 'open');

  console.log('socket is open!');
});
```

The `once` operation returns the argument passed to the event handler. For
example we could use this to grab the [`code`][wscode] that the socket closed
with:

``` javascript
import { main, once } from 'effection';

await main(function*() {
  let socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:1234');

  yield* once(socket, 'open');

  console.log('socket is open!');

  let closeEvent = yield* once(socket, 'close');
  console.log('socket closed with code', closeEvent.code);
});
```

## Recurring events

If you've been following the chapter on [streams and
subscriptions](./collections), you may already have a feeling that it
is not a good idea to repeatedly call `once(socket, 'message')` to
grab the messages sent to a WebSocket. The risk here is that we miss
messages if we're not very careful.

Instead we can use [`on()`][on]. [`on()`][on] is a very convenient
function which takes an [event target][event-target] and the name of
an event, and returns a Stream of values corresponding to the occurences of
that event.

``` javascript
import { main, once, each } from 'effection';

await main(function*() {
  let socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:1234');

  for (let value of yield* each(on(socket, 'message'))) {
    console.log('message:', message.data);
    yield* each.next();
  }
});
```
