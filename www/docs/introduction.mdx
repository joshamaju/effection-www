## Why use Effection?

JavaScript has gone through multiple evolutionary steps in how to deal
with concurrency: from callbacks and events, to promises, and then
finally to `async/await`. Yet it can still be difficult to write
concurrent code which is both correct and composable, and unless
you're very careful, it is still easy to leak resources. Most
JavaScript code and libraries do not handle cancellation well, and so
failure conditions can easily lead to dangling promises and other
unexpected behavior.

Effection brings [structured concurrency][structured concurrency] to
JavaScript so that you can guarantee that you don't leak any
resources, and that cancellation is properly handled. It helps you
build concurrent code that feels rock solid and behaves well under all
failure conditions. It does this all while feeling like very normal
JavaScript.

## Upgrading `async/await`

If you know how to use `async/await`, then you're already familiar with most of
what you need to know to use Effection. The only difference is that instead
of [async functions][], you use [generator functions][]. Generator functions are
similar to async functions but they allow Effection to take greater control over
the execution of your code.

To switch from async functions to generator functions, you can replace:

1. `await` with `yield*`
1. `async function()` with `function*()`


For example, using `async/await` we could write something like this:

``` javascript {1,3-4} showLineNumbers
import { fetch } from 'isomorphic-fetch';

export async function fetchWeekDay(timezone) {
  let response = await fetch(`http://worldclockapi.com/api/json/${timezone}/now`);
  let time = await response.json();
  return time.dayOfTheWeek;
}
```

The same code using Effection looks like this:

``` javascript
import { fetch } from 'effection';

export function *fetchWeekDay(timezone) {
  let response = yield* fetch(`http://worldclockapi.com/api/json/${timezone}/now`);
  let time = yield* response.json();
  return time.dayOfTheWeek;
}
```

## Your first Effection program

To start using Effection, use the `main` function as an entry
point. In this example, we'll use the previously defined
`fetchWeekDay`.

``` javascript
import { main } from 'effection';
import { fetchWeekDay } from './fetch-week-day';

await main(function*() {
  let dayOfTheWeek = yield* fetchWeekDay('est');
  console.log(`It is ${dayOfTheWeek}, my friends!`);
});
```

Even with such a simple program, Effection is still providing critical
power-ups that you don't get with callbacks,
promises, or `async/await`. For example, if you run the above code in
NodeJS and hit `CTRL-C` while the request to `http://worldclockapi.com` is
still in progress, it will properly cancel the in-flight request
as a well-behaved HTTP client should. All without you ever having to
think about it. This is because every Effection operation contains
the information on how to dispose of itself, and so the actual act of
cancellation can be automated.

This has powerful consequences when it comes to composing new
operations out of existing ones. For example, we can add a time out of
1000 milliseconds to our `fetchWeekDay` operation (or any operation
for that matter) by wrapping it with the `withTimeout` operation from
the standard `effection` module.

``` javascript
import { main, withTimeout } from 'effection';
import { fetchWeekDay } from './fetch-week-day';

await main(function*() {
  let dayOfTheWeek = yield* withTimeout(fetchWeekDay('est'), 1000);
  console.log(`It is ${dayOfTheWeek}, my friends!`);
});
```

If more than 1000 milliseconds passes before the `fetchWeekDay()`
operation completes, then an error will be raised.

What's important to note however, is that when we actually defined our
`fetchWeekDay()` operation, we never once had to worry about timeouts,
or request cancellation. And in order to achieve both we didn't have
to gum up our API by passing around cancellation tokens or [abort
controllers][abort controller]. We just got it all for free.
