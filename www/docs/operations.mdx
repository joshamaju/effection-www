In the introduction, we saw how to replace `async/await` by writing equivalent
code in Effection. We can do this because there are strong analogues between the
way both systems work. However, there are also two key differences that
ultimately make Effection far more robust at handling asynchrony, and in this
section we'll unpack these differences in more detail. In summary: operations
are stateless, and they can be cancelled with grace.

## Stateless

The fundamental unit of abstraction for `async/await` is the `Promise`. They can
be created independently or with an [async function][], but either way,
`Promise` is stateful and will make progress on its own.

If you run the following snippet, it will immediately print `Hello World!` to
the console whether we `await` the result of `sayHello()` or not.

```javascript
async function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello World!");
};

sayHello();
```

By contrast, the following will never print anything no matter how long we wait:

```javascript
function *sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello World!");
};

sayHello();
```

This is because unlike promises, Operations do not do anything by themselves.
Instead, they describe what should be done when the operation is run.

## Running Operations

In the example above, the generator function contains a recipe that says "log
'Hello World' to the console", but it does not actually execute that recipe
itself. We need something else to actually do that.

The simplest way is with the aptly named
[`run()`][run] function. Here it's used to execute the example above:

```javascript
import { run } from 'effection';

run(function* sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello World!");
});
```

This will print `Hello World!` to the console, just as you'd
expect.

The return value we get from `run` is a `Task`. A `Task` is both an operation
and a promise, so we can use it with `await` to integrate Effection into
existing `async/await` code.

```javascript
import { run } from 'effection';

try {
  await run(function*() {
    throw new Error('oh no!');
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```

In addition to `run()`, there is the `main()` function which we
already met in the introduction.  It takes care of a few critical
things for you like ensuring that the operation it's running is halted
when the process or browser shuts down, and printing errors to the
console in case anything goes wrong. If you're writing a program with
Effection from scratch, you should most likely use `main()` as the
entry point. `run()` is more bare-bones, and should only be used when
you need more fine grained control.

Using `main()`, our example looks like this:

```javascript
import { main } from 'effection';

await main(function*() {
  throw new Error('oh no!');
});
```

Instead of needing to catch the error like we did before, `main()`
will handle it for us, including printing it to the console.

## Composing Operations

Entry points like `run()` and `main()` are used usually once at the very
beginning of an Effection program, but the easiest and most common way to
run an operation is to include it in the body of another operation. To do this,
we use the `yield*` keyword, which is the Effection equivalent of `await`.

For example, the `sleep()` operation pauses execution for a specified duration
before resuming. We can call it from any operation using `yield*`;

```javascript
import { main, sleep } from 'effection';

await main(function*() {
  yield* sleep(1000);
  console.log("Hello World!");
});
```

Or, it can be embeded in an operation which itself is embedded in another
operation:

```javascript
import { main, sleep } from 'effection';

function* makeSlow(value) {
  yield* sleep(1000);
  return value;
}

await main(function*() {
  let text = yield* makeSlow('Hello World!');
  console.log(text);
});
```

There is no limit to the number of operations that can be nested within
each other, and in fact, composition is so core to how operations work that
_every operation in Effection eventually boils down to a combination of
just three primitive operations_: `action()`, `resource()`, and `suspend()`.

## Cleanup

Perhaps the most critical difference between promises and operations is that
once started, a promise will always run to completion no matter how long that
takes. Unfortunately, this makes the guarantees of structured concurrency
impossible to provide automatically. Operations, on the other hand, can be
interrupted at any time which means that we never have to worry about them
staying longer than they are absolutely needed.

Let's consider a hypothetical sleep function implemented using `async/await`. It
uses `setTimeout()` to resolve a promise once the sleep time has elapsed.

```js
async function sleep(duration) {
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, duration));
}
```

We can now write our slow hello world program using this version:

```js
async function main() {
  await sleep(1000);
  console.log("Hello World!");
}

await main();
```

This logs `"Hello World!"` to the console after a delay of 1s, and so it works
as expected when we run it... sort of.

But what happens when you no longer care about the outcome of your sleep
operation?

Let's take a hypothetical example of racing two sleep operations against each
other. How long do you think this program takes to execute in Node.js?

```js
async function sleep(milliseconds) {
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, milliseconds));
}

await Promise.race([sleep(10), sleep(1000)]);
```

The anwser is 1000ms even though our intuition tells us that it
should be 10ms. It takes 1000ms because `setTimeout` installs a
callback onto the Node run loop, and our process cannot exit until it is
removed.

While our program will move past the `await` statement after 10ms, it will not
be allowed to exit for another 990ms until the `setTimeout` callback is fired.

By contrast, the equivalent code in Effection will exit immediately after 10ms
as expected because every operation can be interrupted at any time.

```js
import { sleep, race, main } from "effection";

await main(function*() {
  yield* race([sleep(10), sleep(1000)]);
});
```

If we look at the implementation of the `sleep()` operation in Effection, we can
see how this works. It uses two of the fundamental operations:
`action()`, and `suspend()`, to wait until the duration has elapsed.

```js {6-8} showLineNumbers
export function sleep(duration) {
  return action(function* (resolve) {
    let timeoutId = setTimeout(resolve, duration);
    try {
      yield* suspend();
    } finally {
      clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    }
  });
}
```

However, there is a key difference between this version of `sleep()` and the
earlier one we wrote using promises. In this `Operation` based implementation,
there is a `finally {}` block which clears the timeout callback, and it is
because of this that the Effection `sleep()` does not cause the process to hang,
whereas the promise-`sleep()` does.

Furthermore, the operation is crystal clear about the order of its execution.
The steps are:

1. install the timeout callback
2. suspend until resolved or discarded.
3. uninstall the timeout callback

If we always follow those steps, then we'll always resume at the right point,
and we'll never leak a timeout effect.

## Computational Components

It's amazing to think how so many operations in the Effection
ecosystem can be broken down into a combination of the fundamental:
`action()`, `resource()`, and `suspend()` operations.  Composability
is the key to everything.

Once you become accustomed to programming with Effection, you'll come to realize
that the manner in which operations compose resembles in a large part the
way UI components click together in a frontend framework. In a frontend
framework, when a parent component is un-rendered, it is understood that it is
not the programmer's responsibility to un-render the children, only that they
ensure each child is written to take whatever steps necessary to un-render
itself.

By the same token, Effection Operations seemlessly bundle setup and
teardown together into composable units so that when any operation
passes out of scope (or is un-rendered to use the parlance of the UI
world) all subordinate operations also pass out of scope. This in turn
allows cleanup to happen both automatically and relentlessly; leaving
the programmer free to not worry about it.
