Effection not only simplifies the process of writing tests, but by
managing all the timing complexity of your setup and teardown, it can
often make new kinds of tests possible that beforehand may have seemed
unachievable.

Currently, both [Jest][jest] and [Mocha][mocha] are supported out of the box, but
because of the way Effection works, and because of the nature of task
you have to do while testing, it's easy to integrate it with
any test framework you like.

## Lifecycle

The reason Effection can so effectively power your tests is because the
life-cycle of a test mirrors that of an Effection Task almost perfectly.

Consider that almost every test framework executes the following sequence of
operations when running a test:

1. setup()
2. run()
3. teardown()

While there are certainly different ways of expressing this
syntactically, it turns out that as a fundamental testing pattern, it
is nearly universal. Notice that, like tests, the cleanup of an
effection operation is intrinsic. We can leverage this fact to
associate an effection task with each test.  Then, we run any
operation that is part of the test as a child of that task. After it
is finished, a test's task is halted , thereby halting any sub-tasks
that were running as a part of it.

This means that any resources being used by the testcase such as servers,
database connections, file handles, etc... can be automatically released without
writing any cleanup logic explicitly into the test itself. In essense, your
tests are able to completely eliminate `teardown` altogether and become:

1. setup()
2. run()

## Jest and Mocha

Effection provides packages for seamless integration between [Jest][jest] and
[Mocha][mocha].

To get started, install from NPM

### Writing Tests

Let's say we have a test case written without the benefit of effection that
looks like this:

``` javascript
describe("a server", () => {
  let server: Server;
  beforeEach(async () => {
    server = await startServer({ port: 3500 });
  });

  it('can be pinged', async () => {
    let response = await fetch('http://localhost:3500/ping');
    expect(response.ok).toBe(true);
  });

  afterEach(async () => {
    await server.close();
  });
});
```
:::note Cleanup

It is critical that we shutdown the server after each test. Otherwise, node
will never exit without a hard stop because it's still bound to port
`3500`, and worse, every subsequent time we try and run our tests they will fail
because port `3500` is not available!
:::

To re-write this test case using effection, there are two superficial
differences from the vanilla version of the framework.

1. You `import` all of your test syntax from the effection package, and not
from the global namespace.
2. You use [generator functions instead of async functions][replace-async] to
express all of your test operations.

Once we make those changes, our test case now looks like this.

> TODO: tab item

``` javascript
import { beforeEach, afterEach, it } from '@effection/jest';

describe("a server", () => {
  let server: Server;
  beforeEach(function*() {
    server = yield startServer({ port: 3500 });
  });

  it('can be pinged', function*() {
    let response = yield fetch('http://localhost:3500/ping');
    expect(response.ok).toBe(true);
  });

  afterEach(function*() {
    yield server.close();
  });
});
```

> TODO: tab item

``` javascript
import { beforeEach, afterEach, it } from '@effection/mocha';

describe("a server", () => {
  let server: Server;
  beforeEach(function*() {
    server = yield startServer({ port: 3500 });
  });

  it('can be pinged', function*() {
    let response = yield fetch('http://localhost:3500/ping');
    expect(response.ok).toBe(true);
  });

  afterEach(function*() {
    yield server.close();
  });
});
```

But so far, we've only traded one syntax for another. Now however, we can
begin to leverage the power of Effection to make our test cases not only more
concise, but also more flexible. To do this, we use the fact that each test
case gets its own task that is automatically halted for us after it runs.

So if we re-cast our server as a [resource][] that is running as a
child of our test-scoped task, then when the test task goes away, so
will our server.


> TODO: tab item

``` javascript
import { ensure } from 'effection';
import { beforeEach, it } from '@effection/jest';

describe("a server", () => {
  beforeEach(function*() {
    yield {
      name: 'ping server',
      *init() {
        let server = yield startServer({ port: 3500 });
        yield ensure(() => server.close())
      }
    }
  });

  it('can be pinged', function*() {
    let response = yield fetch('http://localhost:3500/ping');
    expect(response.ok).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

> TODO: tab item

``` javascript
import { ensure } from 'effection';
import { beforeEach, it } from '@effection/mocha';

describe("a server", () => {
  beforeEach(function*() {
    yield {
      name: 'ping server',
      *init() {
        let server = yield startServer({ port: 3500 });
        yield ensure(() => server.close())
      }
    }
  });

  it('can be pinged', function*() {
    let response = yield fetch('http://localhost:3500/ping');
    expect(response.ok).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

We don't have to write an `afterEach()` _at all_ anymore, because the resource
knows how to tear itself down no matter where it ends up running.

This has the added benefit of making your tests more refactorable. For example,
let's say that we decided that since our server is read-only, we can actually
start it once before all of the tests run, so we move it to a _suite_ level
hook. Before, we would have had to remember to convert our teardown hook as
well, but with Effection, we can just move our resource to its new location.

> TODO: tab item

``` javascript
import { ensure } from 'effection';
import { beforeAll, it } from '@effection/jest';

describe("a server", () => {
  beforeAll(function*() {
    yield {
      name: 'ping server',
      *init() {
        let server = yield startServer({ port: 3500 });
        yield ensure(() => server.close())
      }
    }
  });

  it('can be pinged', function*() {
    let response = yield fetch('http://localhost:3500/ping');
    expect(response.ok).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

> TODO: tab item

``` javascript
import { ensure } from 'effection';
import { before, it } from '@effection/mocha';

describe("a server", () => {
  before(function*() {
    yield {
      name: 'ping server',
      *init() {
        let server = yield startServer({ port: 3500 });
        nyield ensure(() => server.close())
      }
    }
  });

  it('can be pinged', function*() {
    let response = yield fetch('http://localhost:3500/ping');
    expect(response.ok).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

It is common to extract such resources into re-usable functions that can be
embedded anywhere into your test suite, and you never have to worry about them
being torn down. For example, we could define our server resource in a single
place:

``` javascript
//server.js
import { ensure } from 'effection';

export function createServer(options) {
  let { port = 3500, name = 'ping server' } = options;
  return {
    name,
    *init() {
      let server = yield startServer({ port });
      yield ensure(() => server.close());
    }
  }
}
```

Then we can use it easily in any test case:

> TODO: tab item

``` javascript
import { beforeAll, it } from '@effection/jest';
import { createServer } from './server';

describe("a server", () => {
  beforeAll(function*() {
    yield createServer({ port: 3500 });
  });

  it('can be pinged', function*() {
    let response = yield fetch('http://localhost:3500/ping');
    expect(response.ok).toBe(true);
  });
});
``

> TODO: tab item

``` javascript
import { before, it } from '@effection/mocha';
import { createServer } from './server';

describe("a server", () => {
  before(function*() {
    yield createServer({ port: 3500 });
  });

  it('can be pinged', function*() {
    let response = yield fetch('http://localhost:3500/ping');
    expect(response.ok).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

### Test Scope

As hinted at above, there are two separate levels of task in
your tests: _suite-scoped_, and _test-scoped_. Effection creates one
task that has the same lifetime as the beginning and end of your test
suite. Any task spawned within it can potentially last across multiple
test runs. By the same token, the _test-scoped_ task is created before
and halted after every single test. Any tasks spawned within it will
be halted immediately after the test is finished. For example:


> TODO: tab item

``` javascript
import { beforeAll, beforeEach, it } from '@effection/jest';
import { createServer } from './server';

describe("a server", () => {
  beforeAll(function*() {
    // started once before both `it` blocks
    // stopped once after both `it` blocks
    yield createServer({ port: 3500 });
  });

  beforeEach(function*() {
    // started before every `it` block
    // stopped after every `it` block,
    yield createServer({ port: 3501 });
  });

  it('can be pinged', function*() {
    let response = yield fetch('http://localhost:3500/ping');
    expect(response.ok).toBe(true);

    let response = yield fetch('http://localhost:3501/ping');
    expect(response.ok).toBe(true);
  });

  it('can be ponged', function*() {
    let response = yield fetch('http://localhost:3500/pong');
    expect(response.ok).toBe(true);

    let response = yield fetch('http://localhost:3501/pong');
    expect(response.ok).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

> TODO: tab item

``` javascript
import { before, beforeEach, it } from '@effection/mocha';
import { createServer } from './server';

describe("a server", () => {
  before(function*() {
    // started once before both `it` blocks
    // stopped once after both `it` blocks
    yield createServer({ port: 3500 });
  });

  beforeEach(function*() {
    // started before every `it` block
    // stopped after every `it` block,
    yield createServer({ port: 3501 });
  });

  it('can be pinged', function*() {
    let response = yield fetch('http://localhost:3500/ping');
    expect(response.ok).toBe(true);

    let response = yield fetch('http://localhost:3501/ping');
    expect(response.ok).toBe(true);
  });

  it('can be ponged', function*() {
    let response = yield fetch('http://localhost:3500/pong');
    expect(response.ok).toBe(true);

    let response = yield fetch('http://localhost:3501/pong');
    expect(response.ok).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

### Caveats

:::note Jest

There is currently a [critical bug in
Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/12259) that causes
teardown hooks to be completely ignored if you hit `CTRL-C` while your
tests are running. This is true for any Jest test whether you're using
Effection or not, but you must be careful about interrupting your
tests from the command line while they are running as it can have
unknown consequences.

If you'd like to see this fixed, please [go to the
issue](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/12259) and leave a
comment.
